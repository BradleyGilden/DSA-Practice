# DJB2 Algorithm

The djb2 algorithm is a popular hash function created by Daniel J. Bernstein. It is widely used in hash table implementations due to its simplicity and effectiveness in generating relatively uniform hash codes.

Here is the pseudocode for the djb2 algorithm:

```Python
#                          Python
hash = 5381
for each character c in key:
    hash = (hash * 33) + c
```
```c
//                         C/C++
unsigned long int hash_djb2(const unsigned char *str)
{
	unsigned long int hash;
	int c;

	hash = 5381;
	while ((c = *str++))
	{
		hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + c; /* hash * 33 + c */
	}
	return (hash);
}
```

In this algorithm, we start with an initial hash value of 5381. Then, for each character in the key (represented by the variable 'c'), we perform the following steps:

1. Multiply the current hash value by 33.
2. Add the ASCII value of the character 'c' to the hash value.

The multiplication by 33 is an arbitrary choice, but it has been found to work well in practice. The addition of the ASCII value of the character helps in incorporating the uniqueness of each character into the hash code.

After iterating over all the characters in the key, the final value of 'hash' is the resulting hash code.

The djb2 algorithm has some desirable properties for a hash function. It produces relatively uniform distribution of hash codes, which helps to reduce collisions. It is also simple and efficient to compute, making it a popular choice for hash table implementations.

However, it's important to note that the djb2 algorithm may not be suitable for all situations. In some cases, different hash functions might be more appropriate, depending on the specific requirements of the application.
