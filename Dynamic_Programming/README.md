This contains practice problems from Alvins dynamic programming course

* ### Part 1: Memoization
  1. Make it work
     * visualize problem as a tree
     * implement tree using recursion
     * test it
  2. Make it efficient
     * add a memo object
     * add a new base case to return memo object
     * store return values into the memo

* canSum -> *Descision Problem*
* howSum -> *Combinatoric Problem*
* bestSum -> *Optimization Problem*

* ### Part 2: Tabulation
