# Stacks (LIFO)


<img src = "resources/stack.png" alt="stack representation" height=300>

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows *LIFO* (Last In First Out) order. Operations can only be performed at the 'top' of the Stack

## Primary Stack Operations:

* Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack. The newly added element becomes the top of the stack.

* Pop: This operation removes and returns the top element of the stack. After the pop operation, the element previously below the top becomes the new top.

## Other Operations

* Peek: This operation allows you to look at the top element of the stack without removing it.

* IsEmpty: This method checks whether the stack is empty or not.

## Applications of Stack:

* Expression Converison: ++i  , i+j, j++
  * used to intepret postfix, infix, prefix notation to know how to handle operations.
* Parenthis Balancing: { ( [ ] ) }
  * used to check for parameter completion
