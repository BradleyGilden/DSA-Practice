## BFS uses:

* **Shortest Path Finding**: BFS can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph. By keeping track of the parent of each node during the traversal, the shortest path can be reconstructed.
* **Cycle Detection**: BFS can be used to detect cycles in a graph. If a node is visited twice during the traversal, it indicates the presence of a cycle.
* **Connected Components**: BFS can be used to identify connected components in a graph. Each connected component is a set of nodes that can be reached from each other.
* **Topological Sorting**: BFS can be used to perform topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Topological sorting arranges the nodes in a linear order such that for any edge (u, v), u appears before v in the order.
* **Level Order Traversal of Binary Trees**: BFS can be used to perform a level order traversal of a binary tree. This traversal visits all nodes at the same level before moving to the next level.
* **Network Routing**: BFS can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a network, making it useful for routing data packets in network protocols.
