## DFS Complexity:

* Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
* Auxiliary Space: O(V + E), since an extra visited array of size V is required, And stack size for iterative call to DFS function.

## DFS uses:

* Compute a graph's minimum spanning tree
* Detect and find cycles in graph
* Check if graph is bipartite
* find strongly connected components
* Topologically sort the nodes of the graph
* find bridges and articulation points
* find augmenting paths in a flow network
* generate mazes
